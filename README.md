Introduction
I solve Project Euler problems to practice and extend my math and programÂ¬ming skills, all while having fun at the same time. 
Here I make my solutions publicly available for other enthusiasts to learn from and to critique. This page lists all of my Project Euler solution code.
Each problem that I solved always includes a C program. Numerous solutions contain a detailed mathematical proof to justify why the imple-mented algorithm is correct.
